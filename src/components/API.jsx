      "Edge Learning Management System (Edge LMS) is my most complex project so far. The objective of this project is to build an academic platform where institutions of all kind can sign up to, and they can easily manage their academic activities. This platform is quite versatile because basically any type of academic institution can sign up to it. It has many features, and as well, a lot of potential for growth. I strongly believe that this will be the next big thing for Nigerian learning institutions. ",
